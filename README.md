VIM Files
=========

My pretty decent VIM setup, optimized for JavaScript development, fast movement 
between files, GIT usage and germany keyboard layout.

Colorscheme is a modified version of symfony, there's also a tool called `convert.py`
in the repository root which converts a `256` colors scheme to a GUI one.
